1. How it works
==================

The Inter-Platform Mobility Service has been designed and implemented
to provide platform-to-platform mobility for JADE agents, a feature
which is not available with the JADE built-in Agent Mobility Service.

This service has been built to be as transparent as possible to the
agent programmer, in the sense that, programming agents that will move
across different platforms will be as easy as moving agents between
JADE containers.

This version of the service doesn't provide a fully featured,
optimal, secure and fault-tolerant migration system. The migration
system provided, althought simple, tries to be the basis to create a
more sophisticated service in the future. It has been built taking
into account the requirements that will surely arise from its
usage by the community.

In this README file we will try to describe the design philosophy and
some notes about the usage, configuration and installation of this
service.

1.1 The core
-------------

The basic idea behind this service is moving agents from platforms to
other platforms carrying them inside FIPA ACL Messages. These messages
are sent between AMS agents of the involved platforms and follow the
rules imposed by some of the FIPA Interaction Protocols
(http://www.fipa.org).

The migration system provided by the IPMS add-on is significantly
different from the usual intra-platform mobility system embedded in JADE.
In the latter in facts the agent's class files are transferred on demand
as they are needed by the agent. This approach is efficient as it only 
transfers actually required classes that are not found in the destination 
container, but may require several interactions between the source and the 
destination containers (one per class) and, as a consequence, highly depends 
on the reliability of the network. 
IPMS on the contrary collects all classes used by an agent at migration time,
packages them in a single ACLMessage together with the agent'state and
transfers everything with a one-shot approach. 

Agent's class files are automatically detected and packaged by the IPMS 
add-on at migration time. Alternatively the programmer can pack an agent
inside a jar file (we call it a "jar agent") to speed-up migration 
performances. More details can be found in section 6.

Once the package containing the agent's code and state is ready it is 
transferred by the source platform AMS to the destination platform AMS. The
latter is responsible for recreating the incoming agent and reactivating it.
 

2. Security Considerations
===========================

It is very important to stress that security implications of using
inter-platform mobility are much more important than in intra-platform
mobility provided by default in the JADE platform. For this reason,
the authors encourage users to read carefully this section and take
into account all the risks of using migration.

Activating inter-platform mobility service implies that the machine
where the JADE platform is running, executes arbitrary code (by means
of an agent) comming from any machine reachable via network.

At the present time, no access control mechanism exists to
decide which incomming agents will be executed and which won't. Using
this version, we can only perform access control by means of a secure
MTP (for instance, HTTPS MTP provides some simple authentication
features that can be used for this purpose) or using network firewalls
to prevent connections from malicious platforms.

In any case, while we don't have access control for incomming mobile
agents we recommend that platforms using inter-platform mobility
services should take some security precautions:

  1. Do not use this mobility service in open environments or in
machines where sensitive information exist.
  2. Try to restrict network access to platforms by using firewalls.
  3. Try to use MTPs with some kind of authentication to prevent the
sending of malicious agent's from foreign platforms.

We hope that in next versions of this mobility service we can provide
some configurable security mechanisms, which allow to build secure
mobile-agent based applications in open environments.


3. Installation
========================

The IPMS Add-on can be downloaded from the Download area of the JAE web site.
To install it, it is sufficient to unzip the installation package in the 
JADE home directory thus obtaining a directory structure similar to that below
jade/
  |--add-ons
       |--...
	   |--ipms/
	       |--doc/
		   |--lib/
		       |--migration.jar
		   |--runSamples/
		   |--src/
  |--...
  |--lib/
      |--commons-codec/
	         |--commons-codec-1.3.jar
	  |--jade.jar
	  
Furthermore be sure both jade.jar, commons-codec-1.3.jar and migration.jar
libraries are included in the classpath when you launch JADE with the IPMS.

Finally proper configurations must be set when launching JADE
- the InterPlatformMobilityService must be activated
- JADE must be instructed to accept "foreign agents" i.e. agents whose 
names do not have the usual form <local-name>@<platform-name> since they
come from a different platform.
The following command line provides an example 

java -cp ... jade.Boot ... -accept-foreign-agents true -services jade.core.mobility.AgentMobilityService;jade.core.migration.InterPlatformMobilityService;jade.core.event.NotificationService ... 

NOTE: If you are working in a Linux environment do remember to escape the ;

The runSamples directory contains an example that can be used to try 
inter-platform mobility and test that everything is OK. Read carefully the 
README file included in the runSamples directory for information about 
how to launch the example.

4. Build
==========================

In case of modifications, the IPMS library (migration.jar) can be rebuilt
opening a shell in the jade/add-ons/ipms directory and typing

ant clean lib

This requires ANT 1.7 or later to be installed.


5. Usage
=========

From the programming point of view inter-platform migration is initiated
by calling the doMove() method exactly as in the case of container-to-container 
mobility. Te only difference is that a PlatformID object must be passed 
as destination location instead of a ContaierID as exemplified below.

AID remoteAMS = new AID("ams@remotePlatform", AID.ISGUID);
remoteAMS.addAddresses("http://remotePlatformaddr:7778/acc");
PlatformID destination = new PlatformID(remoteAMS); 
myAgent.doMove(destination);

Usual callback methods beforeMove() and afterMove() are invoked normally.


6 Class Analysis and JAR Agents
===============================

As we pointed at the beginning, the migration system needs to keep
track of all agent's code. In this version, we provide two ways to
achieve this goal, one which is transparent to the programmer, so
nothing special has to be done, and another that requires to do some
extra steps that we will detail below.

An easy way to isolate the code of an agent from the rest of the code
pointed in the classpath is enforcing that, all agent's that will
migrate to other platforms have all the code they need inside a jar file.

Of course, some times this requirement can be tedious for the agent
programmer who is used to compile agents, put its code in the
classpath and run them within the platform. For this reason, we have
provided a first mechanism in the migration system which automatically
generates a jarfile given an agent. This jarfile contains all agent's
code and the programmer will never notice its existence. This
mechanism has been built examining recursively the agent's main class
looking for all dependant classes, and building a jar from the final
obtained set.

In the present version, it is possible that in some special cases, the
mechanism explained above doesn't detect all the agent classes. This
could happen in agents where, for example, reflection is used to load
classes (eg Class.forName("ClassName").newInstance()). If you
experience problems, in the migration of the agent, related to class
loading it is possible that some class has not been included in the
agent's jar.

To avoid this problems we provide the possibility to manually create
the jar file containing all agent's code by ourselves. In order to do
that follow the next steps:

 1. We must create a jarfile with all our agent's class files. The jar
file name must follows a naming convention, which consists in giving
the agent's main class name as the jar file name. The name of the
class must be the qualified name, so it must contain the package it
belongs, replacing "." by "_". Following this convention, the agent
with main class org.example.MyAgent must be packed in a jar file named
org_example_MyAgent.jar.

 2. Define a folder to place all your jar packed
agents. You can specify it with the following parameter when launching 
JADE from the command line:

java jade.Boot -jade_core_management_AgentManagementService_agentspath=folder

   Of course, a config file can be used for specifying this parameter
instead of using the command line. If we ommit this step, the present
directory when the platform is started is taken for this propose.

 3. The agents like those we have described, do not need to have its
jar files in the classpath, and we load them as we do for normal
agents.
